However for our healthier, oil-free version, simply pop thetacosonto a baking tray with space in between them and bake for 8 minutes or until crispy, flipping half way.STEP 3Drain theblackbeansand empty into your saucepan along with thesmoky adobo sauce, place over a medium heat and warm through, stirring occasionally, until piping hot, around 5 minutes. Add a splash of water if it starts to stick at the bottom. Roughly mash around half of the beans with a fork and set aside.STEP 4Finely shred thebabygemby cutting horizontally across the head. De-stone theavocadoand cut into thin slices flat side down. If you're feeling fancy you could fan the avocado for a more elevated final presentation. Using the palm of your hand, carefully push the avocado down and away from yourself to open it up like a fan without the slices breaking. Cut thelimeinto wedges.STEP 5Lay everything out on your table and then start building your tostadas. Start with a layer ofblackbeans, then shreddedlettuce, dress the lettuce with a drizzle ofcashewcrema, top with some slices ofavocadoand a final drizzle ofsalsamacha.

Served with crispy golden panko tofu, sweet roasted cherry tomatoes on the vine and vitamin-rich tenderstem broccoli. It's delicious and nutritious, with almost 40g of protein per serving.Prep timeTotal timeCooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Preheat your oven to 200°C / 180°C fan, boil your kettle, and take out a roasting tray, a large saucepan and as frying pan.STEP 2Fill a saucepan with boiling water and place it over medium heat. Once boiling, add theorzoand cook for 9 minutes, or until al dente. Scoop out a cup of the pasta water for later, then drain the orzo and set it aside.STEP 3Place thecherry tomatoesandtenderstem broccolion a baking tray, and drizzle with some good-quality olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, then roast for 10–15 minutes, until the tomatoes begin to burst and the tenderstem broccoli is lightly charred.STEP 4Take out two large bowls. Place the dry mix into a bowl and measure out 40ml (80ml for a 4-person portion) of plant milk (or water if you don’t have milk). Slowly add the milk or water and stir until you have a thick batter. Season well with salt and pepper and stir thoroughly until combined. Pour thepankointo the other bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cut thetofuin half lengthwise, then in half again so you have four thin 'steak' like slices. Pat dry each piece with a sheet of kitchen towel and coat them in the batter, then toss it in the panko. Press gently to ensure the panko evenly covers all sides.STEP 5Add about 1 cm of neutral oil to a frying pan and place it over medium-low heat. You can just add a drizzle of oil if you prefer but the tofu won't get quite as crispy. Once the oil is hot enough to sizzle when a small amount of panko is added, carefully place the coatedtofuin the pan to fry. Turn the tofu as each side becomes crispy, cooking until all sides are golden, around 5 minutes total. Remove from the pan and place on kitchen paper to drain any excess oil.STEP 6Place the saucepan you used for the orzo over a medium heat, add thecreamy lemon sauceand gently warm through for a few minutes. Add the cooked orzo and stir well, then add a little of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce to your preferred consistency.

Soft tortillas are filled with chipotle spiced pumpkin, black beans and mozzarella then fried until crispy on the outside and oozing in the centre. Served with creamy guacamole and zingy pink pickled onions. Every mouthful is a guaranteed flavour bomb!Prep time10Total time15Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Finely slice theredonionand place into a small bowl. If it’s a large onion, half for two people will work well. Squeeze over half of thelimeand season with salt. Give the onions a quick mix and leave to pickle while you make the tacos.STEP 2Drain theblackbeansand add to a  small-medium sized bowl. Mash them up with a potato masher or fork until you have a chunky paste that binds together more, then stir through thechipotle pumpkin sauceand the zest of half thelime. Season with salt and pepper.Finely grate theplant-basedmozzarella.STEP 3Wrap the corn tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave for about 30 seconds. This makes them more pliable and prevents cracking or breaking when folding. If you don’t have a microwave you could warm each tortilla in a frying pan without oil for 20 seconds before filling it.To fill the tacos, spread some of thechipotle pumpkin and black bean mixonto each of thetacosleaving 0.5cm of space around the edge. Divide themozzarellabetween them all, then fold them over in half. Add a drizzle of oil to your frying pan and place over a medium heat. Once hot, fry the tacos for around 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and crispy. You may need to cook them in batches.STEP 4Make your guacamole while the tacos cook. Pit theavocadoand finely chop thecoriander. Place theavocadointo a small bowl and mash it up with a fork. Add half of thecoriander, the remaining half oflimejuice and season well with salt. You could also add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.STEP 5To serve up, divide thetacosbetween serving bowls, serve theguacamoleandpicklesalongside and garnish with the remainingcoriander. We recommend scooping a little guac and pickles onto the tacos as you eat them.

With Lebanese flavours running through in the tofu spices and a tabbouleh inspired quinoa salad, it’s one of my all time favourite salads.Prep time4Total time10Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Boil your kettle and take out a large frying pan and a saucepan. Fill your saucepan with boiling water from your kettle and place over a medium heat to bring to the boil.STEP 2Cook thequinoain your saucepan with boiling water until al dente, around 8 minutes. Drain and put it aside on a sieve over the saucepan to make sure it's drained very well while you prepare the rest of the dish.STEP 3Cut thetofuinto two blocks, lengthwise. Use a peeler or the slicer on a cheese grater to peel each block into thick ribbons (or slice very thinly with a sharp knife). Place the tofu into a container or bowl. Mix 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil with thetofuspicemixand stir to combine. Pour this over the tofu and gently toss to make sure it's all evenly covered.STEP 4Heat your large frying pan on medium heat and fry thetofufor 4-6 mins until starting to brown on the edges. Take care not to overcook it as it could become too crispy - the slices should still be soft in the middle. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if you like.STEP 5Finely chop theparsley, cut thecherrytomatoesand thinly slice thecucumber. Add them to a mixing bowl with thequinoa. Add a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.season well with salt and pepper and give everything a good mix.STEP 6Spoon the salad into bowls and top with the tofu.

    "method": "Crispy Sweet Potato & Black Bean Taquitos With Cashew 'Feta' Crema & Salsa FrescaFresh, crunchy and packed with 17 different plant varieties, our crispy sweet potato taquitos are full of punchy flavours. Gluten-free corn tortillas are stuffed with chipotle spiced sweet potato and black beans, then baked in the oven until crispy. Served with fresh and crunchy shredded gem lettuce, zingy cherry tomato salsa fresca and fermented cashew 'feta crema. It ticks off half of your daily recommended fibre intake in one delicious meal!NB: you can shallow fry or bake the taquitos for an oil free version.Prep time10Total time15Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1For the best flavour and texture, we recommend shallow frying the taquitos, but if you'd prefer a healthier oil free version you can bake them instead. If you are frying, take out a deep frying pan or wok. If you are baking, pre-heat your oven to  200°C / 220°C fan and take out a roasting tray.STEP 2Drain theblack beansand add to a large bowl. Mash them up with a potato masher or fork until you have a chunky paste that binds together more, then stir through thechipotle sweet potato. Season to taste with salt and pepper.STEP 3Wrap thecorn tortillasin a damp paper towel and microwave for about 30 seconds. This makes them more pliable and prevents cracking or breaking when folding.If you don’t have a microwave you can add a splash of water to each side of the tortilla and warm in a non-stick frying pan (without oil) for 30 seconds on each side, or until soft.Divide theblack beanandchipotle sweet potatomixture between the corn tortillas (8 for two people, 16 for four). Using a spoon, place the mixture in a line along one end of each tortilla, then roll them up tightly and secure the ends with atoothpickto hold the rolled shape.STEP 4Shallow frying:Place a large frying pan over medium-low heat and drizzle in a generous amount of neutral oil. Once the pan is hot, add thetaquitosseam side down - you may need to work in batches to not overcrowd the pan. Cook for a few minutes without moving them to ensure the seam seals, then roll them occasionally to cook all sides until golden brown. Set aside on a plate lined with kitchen towel to remove any excess oil. Remove the toothpicks one cooled a little.Baking:Place the taquitos on a baking tray seam side down and spray or brush the tops with oil. Place in your pre-heated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the shells are crispy. Remove the toothpicks one cooled a little.STEP 5To make the salsa fresca, finely chop thecherry tomatoesandred onion. If it’s a large onion, half for two people will work well. Squeeze over half of thelimeand season with salt and pepper. Mix well to combine.Finely slice thebaby gem lettuce, and cut the remaining half of alimeinto wedges and set aside.STEP 6To serve, divide the slicedbaby gem lettucebetween serving plates and place the crispytaquitoson top.

In one bowl, add thekatsu batter mixand measure out 40ml of plant milk (or 80ml for a 4-person portion). If you don’t have milk, water will work too. Slowly add the liquid, stirring until you have a thick batter.

    "method": "Glazed Tofu With Soy Garlic Dressing, Sticky Rice, Charred Broccoli, Edamame & Crispy Chilli ShallotsSoft tofu glazed in a sticky chilli, garlic, ginger and soy sauce, garnishes with fresh spring onions and crispy shallots. Served over sticky jasmine rice with charred broccoli florets and edamame beans for extra protein.Prep timeTotal timeCooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Take out a frying pan (cast iron works best for charring the broccoli if you have one!) and two saucepans.STEP 2Slice the tofu lengthways into four slices (you can slice the tofu in half and then those slices in half again to make them equal. Place them into your saucepan, cover with cold water and add salt. Bring the water to a gentle simmer and continue cooking for 15 minutes. This technique of cooking tofu draws water out more evenly and tightens the protein bonds for better texture.STEP 3Meanwhile, add thejasminericeto your smaller saucepan and cover with 2x its volume in water. Place over a medium-high heat, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook until fluffy, around 8 minutes.STEP 4Place your frying pan over a high heat and add a drizzle of oil. While it heats up, cut thebroccoliinto even florets, around 3cm cubed. Fry in the pan until charred on the outside and tender (but still with some bite) in the centre, around 5-8 minutes. In the final 2 to 3 minutes, add theedamame. Season well with salt and pepper and a squeeze of half alimeand cut the remaining half into two wedges to set aside for later. Remove from the pan and set aside, and wipe the pan clean with some kitchen towel.STEP 5Give thesoy garlic dressinga good shake while the pouch is sealed (in case the cornstarch has separated while sitting in the fridge) then empty it into a small bowl. Finely slice thespringonionand stir them through the sauce in the bowl to make the tofu glaze. When the tofu, rice and vegetables are all ready to serve, heat the sauce in your frying pan for 1 to 2 minutes or until it's hot and has thickened up a little.

    "method": "Hispi Cabbage Gratin In Creamy Cashew Sauce With Garlic & Herb Tempeh 'Pancetta' PangrattatoSmokey charred hispi cabbage in a creamy, umami-packed cashew sauce, finished with the most delicious garnish you've ever tasted - crispy tempeh 'pancetta', garlic toasted breadcrumbs and fresh parsley. It sounds like it shouldn't be healthy, but it's one of the healthiest, most nutritious meals we've ever designed, with a whopping 42g of protein, 2/3rds of your daily recommended fibre intake and lots of gut-friendly ferments like tempeh and miso.Prep time2Total time15Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Preheat your oven to 220°C / 200°C fan and take out a frying pan and a wide casserole dish with a lid (or an ovenproof dish / roasting tray and some tin foil).STEP 2Place your frying pan over high heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Cut thehispi cabbageinto quarters, keeping the core intact so the leaves stay together. Once the pan is hot, sear the wedges cut-side down for about 5 minutes, or until nicely charred. Season well with salt and pepper, then transfer the wedges to a roasting dish and cover with a lid or tin foil. Roast for 10–15 minutes, or until tender. If you prefer a softer texture, add a splash of water to the dish to help the cabbage steam.STEP 3Clean the frying pan you used for the hispi cabbage, then place it back over medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Grate thegarlic clovesand add them to the pan along with thepanko breadcrumbs. Cook until golden, then remove from the pan and set aside. Pick theparsleyleaves and finely chop them, then combine them in a small bowl with the garlic breadcrumbs once ready.STEP 4Finely dice thetempehinto small 5mm cubes. Place the frying pan back over medium-high to high heat and add a generous drizzle of olive oil. Add the tempeh cubes and fry for around 7-10 minutes or until golden and crispy, making sure they are well spread out and stirred occasionally. Once crispy, add thetempeh ‘pancetta’ marinade, stir to coat all the pieces evenly, and turn off the heat.STEP 5When there are 5 minutes left on the hispi cabbage, remove the cover and pour thecreamy gratin saucearound the cabbage wedges. Return to the oven and cook until the sauce is piping hot and the cabbage is tender and golden.STEP 6To serve, you can either scatter thetempeh 'pancetta'andherby breadcrumbsover thehispi cabbagein your oven dish and place in the middle of the table to serve 'feasting style'oryou could divide the saucy hispi cabbage between serving bowls and then add the garnish.

Best of all, it's totally guilt free - packed with over 30g of protein and over 80% of your daily recommended fibre intake, thanks to the wholewheat pasta, lentils and a side of healthy greens and peas.Prep time3Total time15Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Boil your kettle then take out two saucepans (ideally including one that has a steamer basket to go with it), and a deep frying pan or wok.STEP 2Pour boiling water from your kettle into your larger saucepan and place over medium heat. Once it's bubbling add thewholewheat rigatoniand cook until al dente, around 12 minutes. Scoop out a mug full (approx 100ml) of pasta water, then drain the pasta.STEP 3Place your deep frying pan or wok back over a medium heat. Meanwhile finely dice thechestnutmushroomsinto approx 1cm cubes - you want to dice rather than slice to get a mince-like texture for the sauce. Add a drizzle of olive oil to your pan and fry off the mushrooms until they are browned off and tender, around 5-7 minutes.STEP 4Fill a little boiling water in your other saucepan and place the steamer basket over the top. While it is brought back to a boil, cut thesavoy cabbageinto large chunks then steam until wilted, around 10 minutes. Add thegardenpeasfor the final 3 minutes of cooking time. If you don't have a steamer you can boil instead for the same amount of time. Season the greens well with salt and pepper and stir through some vegan butter or extra virgin olive oil (optional).STEP 5Once the diced mushrooms are fried off, drain thelentilsthen add them to the pan along with theporcini ragu sauceand cook until piping hot, for around 3-4 minutes. Once the pasta is cooked, add into the pan along with some of the reserved pasta water to loosen up the sauce a little. Stir everything well to combine. We’ve kept this recipe healthy, but you could add some vegan butter and cheese to the pasta at this point if you wanted make it more indulgent!STEP 5To serve up, divide therigatoniinporciniragubetween serving bowls and serve thesavoycabbageandgardenpeasalongside.

Add the shredded tofu into your roasting tray, season generously with salt and pepper and toss in a healthy glug of olive oil. You could add some soy sauce for extra flavour if you have some (optional). Place in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until it's starting to get crispy in some places, but not burned. It should be more dried out and not watery.\nSTEP 3\nMeanwhile, finely dice half of the\nred\nonion\n, dice the\ntomato\n, finely chop the\ncoriander\nand remove the flesh from the\navocado\n. Place the\navocado\ninto a bowl, season well with salt and squeeze in half of the lime. Mash the avocado up with a fork until you have a smooth guacamole. Stir through a healthy drizzle of extra virgin olive oil to make it nice and glossy (optional). Place the chopped\ntomato\ninto a separate bowl with half of the\ncoriander\n, the diced red onion, the other half of\nlime\njuice and season well with salt and pepper. This is your pico de gallo.\nSTEP 4\nOnce the tofu is done in the oven, pour the\nguajillo\nadobo\nsauce\ninto your saucepan and warm through over a medium-low heat. Turn it off the heat and stir through the roasted tofu.\nSTEP 5\nDry fry (without oil) the\ntortillas\nin your large frying pan until lightly charred and warmed through.\nSTEP 6\nTo serve up, divide the\ntortillas\nbetween serving plates and build your tacos starting with the\nguacamole\n, then\nshredded adobo tofu\nand top with the\npico de gallo\n. Garnish with the remaining\ncoriander\nand enjoy!",

Tender udon noodles are tossed in a smoky, spicy, moreish sauce, topped with a crispy mushroom, tofu and walnut mince, shredded pak choi, toasted peanuts and freshly sliced spring onions. Guaranteed to wake up your taste buds and leave you craving for more.Prep time4Total time15Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Boil your kettle, then take out a saucepan and a large frying pan. Fill your saucepan with boiling water from your kettle, place over a high heat and bring to the boil for the noodles.Crumble thetofuinto roughly minced pieces. Dice thechestnutmushroomsinto small cubes, around 0.5-1cm. Slice thepakchoiinto bite-sized pieces. Finely slice thespringonions, keeping the green and white parts separate. This is all your veg prep done.STEP 2Place your frying pan over medium heat and add thepeanuts and walnuts. Dry fry them (without oil) for 3-4 minutes or until nicely toasted, tossing occasionally so they don't burn. Set aside and roughly chop or crush them by pressing down on them with a rolling pin or bottom of a heavy pan. Wipe the pan clean with kitchen towel.STEP 3Place your frying pan over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of oil (sesame oil works well, but any oil will do). Once hot, add the white parts of thespring onionsand the crumbledtofu, and cook until the tofu begins to crisp up.Add the dicedchestnut mushroomsand continue cooking until everything is nicely browned. Toss in the slicedpak choiand cook until just softened but still slightly crunchy.Turn off the heat, then pour in two-thirds of thedan dan sauceand stir well to coat. Add a splash of water if needed to achieve a saucy consistency.Note: For a four-person kit, you may need to use two frying pans to brown the tofu and mushrooms separately before combining them in one pan with the sauce.STEP 4Meanwhile, add theudon noodlesto your saucepan of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until tender but still al dente. Once cooked, drain and rinse the noodles under cold water - this helps remove excess starch and prevents them from becoming soggy. Set them aside in a colander to drain while you wait for the mince to finish.STEP 5Boil your kettle again, then set the colander with the rinsedudonnoodlesover the sink and pour the boiling water over them to warm them up. Drain well.STEP 6To serve up, divide the cookednoodlesbetween serving bowls. Top with thedan dan minceand drizzle over the remainingdan dansauce.

    "method": "Sri Lankan Daal With Crispy Courgette & Corn Fritters, Date Tamarind Chutney & Organic Soy YoghurtIf you love a daal and you love crispy fritters, then you'll love this dish! Our new Sri Lankan inspired daal is made by tempering curry leaves, black mustard seeds and an assortment of fragrant spices and aromatics, which are then simmered in coconut milk with red lentils until tender. Topped with courgette and corn fritters which are crispy on the outside and perfectly spiced in the centre, all smothered in a sweet and sour date tamarind chutney and cooling organic soy yoghurt. Heaven!Prep time5Total time15Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Take out a large saucepan, a large frying pan and a large mixing bowl.STEP 2Grate thecourgettethen place it into a sieve or perforated colander rested over a bowl or colander. Toss it in a large pinch of sea salt, set aside for 10 minutes, then squeeze and drain as much liquid as you can from the courgette. If you don't do this your fritters won't crisp up.STEP 3Add thesrilankandaalsauce, red lentils and 300ml of water (or 600ml for a 4 person box) to your saucepan and cook for 10-15 mins until the lentils are soft and tender. Stir occasionally while cooking and add a splash of water as needed if it reduces too much or starts to stick. Season to taste with salt.STEP 4Drain thesweetcornand add it into your large mixing bowl with the squeezedcourgetteandfritter dry batter. Season well with salt and pepper. You may need to add a little water to bind the batter mix. The less water you use, the crispier your fritters will be so start with 50ml and add more if needed until the mix is just starting to stick together (it will bind better once it's fried!).STEP 5Heat a drizzle of oil in your frying pan over a medium heat. Add a large spoonful of the batter mix to the pan and press down to form a 1cm thick fritter (they don’t need to be perfect circles!). Cook each side for 4-5 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining batter.STEP 6Divide thesrilankandaalbetween serving bowls, top with the spiced courgette and corn fritters, drizzle over thesoyyoghurtanddatetamarindchutney, and garnish the dish with a few pickedcorianderleaves to finish.

Served with a side of fluffy basmati rice for a delicious, high protein, high fibre bowl that will leave you feeling satisfied and full of energy.Prep timeTotal timeCooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1We highly recommend using a cast iron pan or griddle to char the oyster mushrooms if you have one. If you don't a frying pan will work too. As well as this, take out two saucepans and a mixing bowl.STEP 2Add thesri lankan daalsauce,red lentilsand 300ml of water (or 600ml for a 4 person box) to one of your saucepans and bring to a simmer, then cook for 10-15 mins until the lentils are soft and tender.

Drain and set aside to keep warm.STEP 4Tear theoyster mushroomsinto 1.5-2cm strips and add them to your mixing bowl along with theoyster mushroom spice mix, a glug of neutral oiland a good amount of salt and pepper. Give everything a good mix with your hands until the mushrooms are well coated in marinade. Thread the marinated oyster mushroom pieces onto the wooden skewersSTEP 5Place your cast iron griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of oil to coat the bottom. Once the pan is searing hot, add the marinadedmushroom skewers. We recommend compressing the oyster mushrooms with a spatula or slotted turner so that they flatten and get crispier. Cook until crispy and blackened a little, around 5 minutes on each side.STEP 6In the meantime, drain and dice thecooked beetrootinto 1.5-2cm cubes and place in a mixing bowl.

    "method": "Superfood Black Bean Chilli Over Roasted Sweet Potato With Zingy Guacamole & Crunchy Tortilla ChipsBig, bold Mexican flavours come together in perfect harmony to make this delicious, nourishing, comforting meal. We've got a deeply rich, smokey black bean chilli with crushed walnuts and sunflower seeds for extra depth and nutrition, served generously over a fibre-rich roasted sweet potato. At home you'll serve it with a creamy, zingy guacamole and your very own home made crunchy tortilla chips to dip and dunk to your heart's content. With almost 30g of fibre, you'll be ticking off your entire daily recommended fibre intake in one meal. Your gut health owes you a big thank you for this one!Prep timeTotal timeCooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Preheat your oven to 220°C / 200°C fan and take out a baking tray and a saucepan.STEP 2Prick thesweetpotatoall over with a paring knife or fork, then microwave on high for 5-6 minutes, rotating halfway through (be careful as they will be hot). Place onto a baking tray, cover in olive oil, salt and pepper and then roast in the oven for 15 minutes or until soft. If you don't have a microwave you can bake the sweet potato from raw but it will take longer - just slice in half (or quarters if it’s a very large potato) lengthways, rub with olive oil, salt and pepper, and cook cut-side up until lightly browned and tender, around 30 minutes depending on the size of the sweet potato.STEP 3Use scissors or a knife to cut thefreshcorntortillasinto triangles, place into your smaller baking tray and drizzle or brush them with a little olive oil. Once the sweet potato has had 5 minutes, bake the corn tortillas for the final 10 minutes of cooking time until perfectly crispy, turning halfway through. Season with a little salt and pepper. Remove and set aside.STEP 4Drain theblack beansand reserve the juices. Add thesuperfoodchilli sauceto your saucepan along with theblack beans. When there's around 5 minutes left on the sweet potato, place over a medium-high heat and warm through until piping hot, around 5 minutes. If the sauce reduces too much, add a little of the reserved black bean juices while cooking.STEP 5To make the guacamole, scoop out the flesh from theavocadoand place into a bowl. Finely chop thecoriander(reserving a few leaves for garnishing) and add to the bowl with the avocado. Squeeze in thelimejuice to taste, season with salt and add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (optional). Mash the avocado up with a fork and give everything a good stir to combine the flavours.STEP 6Remove thesweetpotatofrom the oven, slice open lengthways and place half on each serving bowl or plate.

    "method": "Thai Red Curry Sweet Potato Fritters Over Crunchy Mixed Veg & Quinoa Slaw With Aromatic Red Curry DressingCrispy on the outside and full of flavour on the inside, these moreish fritters are packed with delicious sweet potatoes, spring onions and aromatic spices. Served on top of a crunchy, refreshing mixed veg and quinoa slaw and smothered in a heavenly Thai red curry dressing featuring chilli, coconut, lemongrass, ginger and lime. All finished with spring onions and a scattering of white and black sesame seeds.Prep timeTotal timeCooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Boil your kettle, then take out a saucepan and a large frying pan (non-stick works best for fritters).STEP 2To prepare for the quinoa slaw, fill a saucepan with boiling water from the kettle and place it over medium-high heat. Once it’s bubbling, add thequinoaand cook for 6–8 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and set aside, keeping it warm. Finely slice thered and white cabbage wedges(using a mandolin if you have one), and place them in a bowl with a sprinkle of salt. Massage the cabbage to help it release its natural juices and soften. If you like, add a splash of vinegar and a drizzle of oil at this stage. Set aside until assembling the meal in Step 5.STEP 3Finely slice spring onions, separating the whites and greens. Grate thesweet potatointo a large mixing bowl using the medium-size side of the grater. Add thefritter dry mix, the white part of thespring onionsand season well with salt and pepper, and give it all a good mix until well combined and the texture is like a dough. Make your fritters using your hands, aiming for approximately 1cm thick and 10cm in diameter. They don't need to be perfect circles as rougher edges will turn nice and crispy!If the fritters don't stick together, you can add a splash of water to the mix as required. However the less moisture in the batter, the crispier the fritters will get when cooking and they will also bind together more as they're fried.STEP 4Place your frying pan over a medium heat and add a neutral oil (e.g. rapeseed, sunflower, groundnut oil). The example image is shallow fried to make them extra crispy, but you can just add a drizzle of oil if you prefer less. Fry thefrittersin batches for 4-5 minutes on each side or until crispy on the outside and cooked through in the centre. You should get around 2-3 fritters per person.STEP 5To finish off the quinoa slaw, combine the cookedquinoa, sliced & marinatedcabbageslices,sesameseeds,springoniongreens with a splash ofred Thai curry dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper and reserve the remaining of the dressing to drizzle over the fritters. We recommend reserving some sesame seeds and spring onion for garnishing too.STEP 6To serve up, divide thesaladbetween serving plates or bowls, top with thefrittersand drizzle over thered Thai curry dressing.

All you need to do is break the lasagne sheets into our super green sauce, along with courgettes, tender butter beans and dollops of our silky miso bechamel, then bake in the oven until melted and bubbling. Finish with toasted flaked almonds, hazelnuts, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds for extra nutrition and vitamins.Prep time4Total time30Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Preheat your oven to 220°C / 200°C fan and take out a large casserole dish or an oven-proof deep pan, along with a blender or a large mixing bowl and a stick blender. Don't worry if you don't have a blender as we will provide an alternative method below.STEP 2Place your casserole dish or ovenproof pan over medium-high heat and drizzle in some olive oil. Slice thecourgetteinto 0.5cm rounds, add to the pan, and sauté until they are softened and lightly browned.STEP 3In the meantime, add thesuper green lasagnesauceandbaby spinachinto a blender, and blend until the sauce is smooth and vibrant green. Alternatively, you can use a mixing bowl and a stick blender for this process. We deliver the sauce and spinach separately for better flavour and colour.If you don't have a blender, you can alternatively wilt the spinach in the sauce by gently heating in a small saucepan for a few minutes.Once thecourgetteshave softened a little, pour the sauce into the pan along with 50ml of water (double the measurement for a four person portion size), and thebutter beans(including the water). Give everything a good mix and cook until it's lightly bubbling, around 3 minutes.STEP 4Break thelasagne sheetsinto 3-4 pieces each and add them to the simmeringsuper green lasagnesauce.Stir well to ensure the lasagne sheets are separated and evenly distributed in the sauce, then place the dish in the pre-heated oven and bake for 10 minutes.Remove the lasagne from the oven, pour over themiso bechameland return it to the oven for another 15-20 minutes or until the bechamel is a little thicker. If you have time, leave the lasagne to rest for 5 minutes before serving so it’s easier to cut and serve.STEP 5Meanwhile, toast thenuts and seedsby dry frying (without oil) in a small frying pan until golden, around 2-4 minutes.STEP 6To serve, drizzle or scatter the toasted nuts and seeds over the wild garlic lasagne, divide between serving bowls and enjoy!What’s in your boxSuper Green Lasagne SauceCourgetteMiso BechamelLasagne SheetsButterbeansBaby SpinachNuts & SeedsNutritional infoAll nutritional values are based on a per person scale.Calories661kcalTotal fat31.7gSaturated fat4.9gSalt1.3gTotal carbohydrate72gTotal sugar11.6gFibre13.7gProtein27.3gIngredients / AllergensLasagne sheets (durum wheat semolina (gluten)), cashews (nuts), nutritional yeast, extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice, basil, water, garlic, white miso (soybeans, rice, salt), sea salt, rapeseed oil, soy milk (soybeans), potato flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, rice vinegar, raw organic agave nectar, hazelnuts (nuts), pumpkin seeds, almonds (nuts), sunflower seeds, butter beans, courgette, baby spinach, wild garlicFor allergens please see ingredients inboldPlease be advised that we handle the following allergens in our kitchen: CELERY, SOYA, GLUTEN, NUTS, PEANUTS, MUSTARD, SESAME SEEDS, SULPHITES",

    "method": "Winter Harvest Bowl With Roasted Sweet Potato, Candied Walnuts & Maple Tahini DressingThis deliciously healthy salad is the ultimate healthy reset for your body and mind. It's packed with gut-loving fibre and is bursting with flavour, thanks to layers of shredded cavolo nero, sweet crunchy apple and roasted sweet potato topped with pomegranate jewels, toasted walnuts and a generous drizzle of creamy tahini dressing spiked with tangy pomegranate molasses.Prep time5Total time20Cooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Boil your kettle, pre-heat your oven to 220°C / 200°C fan, then take out a large roasting tray and a saucepan.STEP 2Dice thesweetpotatointo 1.5cm cubes, place into your roasting tray, toss through a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 15-20 minutes or until crispy on the outside and cooked through. Add thewalnutsto the roasting tray for the final 2-3 minutes of cooking time.

Roll the leaves up very tightly in your hands, then use a sharp knife to finely slice the leaves. Place into a large mixing bowl, add a pinch of salt and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (optional), then massage the cavolo nero with your hands until it softens.NB: This is a raw cavolo nero recipe, but if you're not a raw cavolo nero lover, you could boil or steam the leaves for 10 minutes or roast them in the oven for 10 minutes tossed in oil, salt and pepper to make them crispy.STEP 5Cut theapplein half, remove the core, then thinly slice.STEP 6To serve up, toss thecavolonero,sweetpotatoandquinoain half of thetahinidressing, then top with theappleslices,candiedwalnutsand a scattering ofpomegranateseeds.

    "method": "Yaki Udon Noodles With Aubergine, Savoy Cabbage, Carrot, Mushroom & Omega 3 Superseed FurikakeYaki udon is one of our favourite meals as it's packed with lots of fresh vegetables and chewy udon noodles, which are so good at soaking up all the flavours in the rich, savoury sauce. We've served it with melt-in-your-mouth aubergine, charred savoy cabbage, meaty mushrooms and julienned carrot, all finished with omega-3 rich furikake seasoning featuring chia, sesame, pumpkin and sunflower seeds.Prep timeTotal timeCooking Mode:\nCooking instructionsBefore you start, take out all the ingredients for this recipe (see picture above) and rinse any raw grains, herbs or vegetables.STEP 1Boil your kettle, then take out a saucepan and a large frying pan or a wok. Fill your saucepan with boiling water from your kettle, place over a high heat and bring to the boil for the noodles.STEP 2Add theudonnoodles to the boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until tender but still al dente. Once cooked, drain and rinse the noodles under cold water. This helps remove excess starch and prevents them from becoming soggy. Set them aside in a colander to drain.STEP 3Diceauberginelengthways into ~2cm cubed pieces. Slice or quarter thechestnut mushroomsand slice thesavoy cabbage~1cm thick. Use a peeler to createcarrotribbons and thinly slice thespring onions.STEP 4Place your frying pan or wok over high heat and add a generous drizzle of neutral oil, or sesame oil if you have it, as it works well with this dish. Add theaubergineonce the oil is hot and fry until soft and lightly golden on both sides, around 6-8 minutes. Then add thesavoy cabbageandchestnut mushroomsand cook for a further 4-5 minutes until soft. You can add a small splash of water to help the vegetables steam and soften. Add thecarrotribbons last, along with theyaki udon sauce, and combine everything well.Finally, add the cooked and drainedudonnoodles. Toss everything together and cook for another minute or so over high heat to warm through the noodles. Add a splash of water or an extra drizzle of oil if it feels dry, and allow the sauce to start caramelising on the vegetables and noodles.STEP 6To serve, divide theyaki udonbetween serving bowls and finish with slicedspring onionsand a sprinkle offurikake seasoning.
